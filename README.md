Wondering what's here?

- [**sql-cs**](./sql-cs/code/readme.md): Here you'll find resources from a presentation titled "Leveraging AI in SQL Server 2019". This presentation covers putting SQL Server 2019 ML Services + Java Extensibility, Cognitive Services, and Containers together in ways that make sense in the real world.
- [**sql-ml**](./sql-ml/code/readme.md): Here you'll find resources from a presentation titled "SQL Server ML End-to-End". This presentation covers using Python and/or TSQL to go through the Team Data Science Process to perform in-database machine learning.
- [**sql-cs-icc**](./sql-cs-icc/code/readme.md): Here you'll find the resources from a presentation "Adding AI to your SQL Server Applications with Containerized Cognitive Services" at the Intelligent Cloud Conference. This presentation is similar to the sql-cs presentation above, except it goes deeper into creating LUIS models, and deploying containers with them.  
- [**sql-build**](./sql-build/readme.md): Here you'll find resources from a presentation "Deploying apps for on-prem and hybrid ML+AI on SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters". These materials walk you through how to use Java with Big Data Clusters, how to deploy other containers into your cluster (specifically Cognitive Services), how to deploy LUIS models, and more. There is a walk through that you can follow to get set up as well!  
- [**sql-mlads**](./sql-build/readme.md): Here you'll find the resources from a presentation "Adding AI to your SQL Server Applications with Containerized Cognitive Services" at the internal MLADS conference in Spring 2019. This presentation is similar to the sql-cs presentation above, except it goes deeper into creating LUIS models, and deploying containers with them.  
- [**sql-pass**](./sql-pass): Here you'll find the resources from a presentation "A behind the scenes look at AI, ML, and DL" at PASS Summit and the Azure AI conference in November 2019.
- [**sql-intersection**](./sql-intersections): Here you'll find the resources from a presentation "Azure SQL Database: Maximizing Cloud Performance and Availability" at PASS Summit, Ignite, and SQLIntersections in November 2019.
- [**sql-w2uw**](./sql-w2uw): Here you'll find the resources from various presentations where I present Azure SQL: What to use when.
